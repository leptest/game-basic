## Running the game locally

From the terminal in the project directory, you can run:

### Installation

This downloads and installs all the required packages. If you don't have yarn installed, run `npm install yarn -g`.

### Run local server

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Production build

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and is optimized for the best performance.
