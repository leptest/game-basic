## TODO
* starting/home screen
* death screen
* win screen


* reset health/mana on new battle-- take current health/mana with? (realistic)
* if trying to attack with no mana, fail attack


* ~~get health and mana potions working~~
* potions to have charges (that reset each battle)
* pot value = %-max health/mana?


* add basic attacks (single, aoe)


* add basic inventory
* add loot if you win battle


* add turn order calculation
* add turn system

* add local storage / save state
* add saved/different characters? So we can start playing ;p

## BUGS
* if you level up twice on one creature, not working. use totalExp (and unspentExp?) prop
* can still attack when dead-- you should be able to hit a creep when it's down! ;p  also re-animate/booby-trap corpse... just stop exp gain & corpse hit back.
* creatures can still attack back when no mana
