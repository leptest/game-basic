## TODO
* starting/home screen
* death screen
* win screen


* reset health/mana on new battle
* if trying to attack with no mana, fail attack, but mob deals damage back? (realistic)


* ~~get health and mana potions working~~
* potions to have charges (that reset each battle)


* add basic attacks (single, aoe)


* add basic inventory
* add loot if you win battle


* add turn order calculation
* add turn system


## BUGS
* if you level up twice on one creature, not working. use totalExp (and unspentExp?) prop
* can still attack when dead
* creatures can still attack back when no mana
